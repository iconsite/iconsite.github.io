                <h2>Welcome to Music Lessons Online!</h2>
                <p>The beauty of online music lessons is that you get a fun, low-key, personal, and interactive lesson, the same as you would in any other setting, but without ever having to leave the house! It is especially convenient if you have small children, or a hectic work schedule, and simply don’t have time to travel somewhere for lessons.</p>
                <p>Lessons are offered in voice, violin, piano, music theory, and the Irish style of fiddling using Facetime.</p>
                <p>Students of all different ages and walks of life are welcome. I am a FIRM believer that it is never too late to begin learning an instrument. Anyone can learn and progress quickly if they have the desire and love for learning, and are willing to put some effort into practicing and improving.</p>
                <p>Music is such a wonderful and integrative part of our lives, and can unite people in fellowship and harmony regardless of cultural or language barriers. Why wait any longer to learn that instrument you’ve always dreamed about. It is never too late to start learning a new skill!</p>
                <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                <p>My teaching philosophy is simple. Music should be FUN! Whether your dream is to become a professional artist, or simply jam with friends on the weekend, my goal as a teacher is to create a fun, safe, inspiring environment where students feel free to explore and discover their music at their own individual pace. Learning music is a beautiful journey, and the ultimate goal is to help students learn and develop their own, unique artistry.</p>
                <p>To start lessons now, sign up by email, it is that quick and simple! A free trial lesson is also available for those uncertain about learning online.  I strive to make the entire process easy and comfortable. If you decide online lessons are not for you, you can cancel at any time.</p>
                <p>Lesson quantities can vary, but are usually once per week. Payment is made the first of each month for a four-week period through Paypal for financial safety and convenience. If you stop lessons before the paid month is up, a refund of the difference will be issued.</p>

                <p>Alina Saras has loved all things music ever since she can remember! From a young age, she grew up listening to classical and ethnic world music, and developed a love for Broadway, Disney songs, Mozart, Chopin, and the ethnic music of many countries around the world, including, but not limited to, Japanese, Irish, Greek, Arabic, and Indian music.</p>
                <p>Alina has been studying violin and voice for eighteen years, and piano for ten years. In college she studied classical music performance, history, theory, and multiple languages. After graduating, she backpacked through Europe, visiting beautiful countries such as France, Ireland, Greece, and Italy, where she continued to learn and discover incredible music.</p>
                <p>She has been teaching online for a year now, and enjoying every moment of it, and she hopes you will too!</p>
